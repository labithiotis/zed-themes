## Zed Themes

Welcome to zed themes, a place to create, share and explore themes for the zed code editor.

It's still very early days for this project, but I'm excited to see where it goes. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

So of the tokens are still a work in progress, zed seems to have more tokens than currently used in the theme file. I will be adding more tokens as I find out what they are used for.

#### Todo

- [x] Theme explorer/viewer
- [x] Share theme via url (maybe use a hash of the theme json)
- [ ] Add social links?
- [ ] Highlight each part of the IDE as you hover over token?
- [ ] Fully support theme groups??

##### Completed

- [x] Buy domaon (zed-themes.com)
- [x] Host on cloudlfare pages
- [x] Export theme to json file
- [x] Upload theme to replace current state (maybe do zod to validate json is valid theme)
- [x] Use css variables for all style and not the theme signal
- [x] Error popup tooltip example
- [x] Warn popup tooltip example
- [x] Git changes in gutter
- [x] Highlights in scrollbar track (git,errors,warnings etc...)
- [x] Link to buy me a coffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/labithiotis
- [x] Use light/dark toggle icon
- [x] Syntax setting font family & weight
- [x] Set player colours
